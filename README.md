This project, "Deep Learning-Based Smart Data Entry System for Document Digitization and Processing," aims to automate data extraction from various document types using deep learning techniques. It focuses on improving accuracy, efficiency, and reducing manual effort in data entry processes.

Key Features & Technologies:

1. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Extracts text from both printed and handwritten documents.

Overcomes limitations of traditional OCR systems in handling complex layouts and handwriting.



2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Contextual Understanding

Enhances extracted text by understanding context and refining accuracy.

Identifies key information such as names, dates, and amounts.



3. Deep Learning Techniques for Improved Accuracy

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based text recognition.

Transformer-based models  to refine extracted text.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence processing.



4. Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Information Extraction

Extracts and categorizes relevant data from documents.



5. User-Friendly Interface

Allows users to upload documents and retrieve structured data efficiently.




Objective & Expected Benefits:

Reduce manual effort and minimize errors in data entry.

Enhance accuracy in document processing.

Enable real-time, AI-powered document handling.
